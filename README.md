# graph-algorithms

This repository contains custom implementations of **graph** and **heap** data structures, as well as several fundamental algorithms in graph theory and optimization.  

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** â€“ Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm (with Heap)** â€“ Computes the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using a heap to efficiently manage edges.
- **Graph Coloring** â€“ Assigns colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, using a brute-force approach.
- **Minimum-Cost Hamiltonian Cycle** â€“ Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem by searching for the minimum-cost Hamiltonian cycle using branch and bound.
